LOG IN TO TESTWEB
1.  Confirm necessary files (global.gdb, str grid) have been pushed to the staging server using KJ's GIS toolbox and the nightly script has pulled it down
2.  Update sources or add items in 'stateservices_legacy.mxd'
3.  Rename old state folder in \mapServices\sc ie: "sc_old" (we should change this to the server it's on e.g. sc_prod, sc_test)
4.  Open 'exportStateServiceFiles.py' and update line 26 for specific states.  This script will do a special export of a consistent format of the items in stateservices_legacy for the selected state.
5.  Run 'exportStateServiceFiles.py'
6.  Verify contents in \mapServices\{region abbr} and delete "{region abbr}_old" -- UNLESS the changes aren't cleared for prod yet, then keep the old one just in case
7. If adding new state, open stateservices.mxd and add new group layer and add the layers to publish.

Option 1:
8.  Edit 'publishMapServices.py' and comment/uncomment which service to update in "SERVICELIST" array - IMPORTANT: make sure to add/remove _test from the service name accordingly
9.  Stop and delete old 'stateServices' map service on gis server (gis.streamstats.usgs.gov)
10.  IMPORTANT:  'publishMapServices.py' must be run with 32-bit python ie: "c:\Python27\ArcGIS10.5\python.exe publishMapServices.py"  (This process takes 20-25 minutes for just stateServices)

Option 2:
8. Open stateServices.mxd, make sure everything that needs to be in there is in there (no red explamation point or greyed out layer toggle for the streamgrid or excludepolys layers)
9. In ArcMap, go to File > Share As > Service > Overwrite an existing service > select the service you'd like to overwrite (e.g. stateServices_dev for the dev server, stateServices_test for the test server, stateServices for Prod)
9.a) In the publish window, first run "analyze" to make sure there aren't any errors, then hit "publish".
